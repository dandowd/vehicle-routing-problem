# Build and execute
This was built using go version 1.21.2

run `go build .`
This will out put an executable called vehicle-routing-problem

The executable takes a single argument for location of a problem file

example `./vehicle-routing-problem ./problems/problem1.txt`

# A few comments
- There is a lot of dead code that I didn't prune. I left it for visibility, so I can demonstrate my process as I worked through the problem.
- This is only my second project in go. So my understanding of the language was constantly evolving throughout this project. Leading to some inconsistencies.
